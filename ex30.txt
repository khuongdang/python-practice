# Exercise 30, mother fuckers.

# Creating variables for people, cars, and buses
people = 30

# If cars are greater than people, print this statement

	# Else, if cars are less than people, print this statement
elif cars < people:

# Otherwise, print this statement

# If buses are greater than cars, print this	
if buses > cars:

# Else if buses are less than cars, then print this

# Otherwise, print this

#If people are greater than buses, print this
if people > buses:

# Otherwise, print this.
else:
	print "Fine, lets just stay home then."
